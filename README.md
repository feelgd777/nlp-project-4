# Using Consumer Sentiment to Ad Target Consumers

## Overview 

We are a marketing consulting company named Emo-Vector LLC that specializes in marketing insights derived from emotion. We aim to expand the reach of emerging Asian consumer electronics companies such as Samsung, Xiaomi, Oppo, and Vivo by utilizing targeted online advertising. We hope to use the power of big data to create a model that can swiftly and efficiently target consumers who have non-positive emotions towards brand competitors such as Apple and Google.
